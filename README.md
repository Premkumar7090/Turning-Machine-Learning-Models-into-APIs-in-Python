# Turning-Machine-Learning-Models-into-APIs-in-Python
Consider the following situation:  You have built a super cool machine learning model that can predict if a particular transaction is fraudulent or not. Now, a friend of yours is developing an android application for general banking activities and wants to integrate your machine learning model in their application for its super objective.  But your friend found out that, you have coded your model in Python while your friend is building his application in Java. So? Won't it be possible to integrate your machine learning model into your friend's application?  Fortunately enough, you have the power of APIs. And the above situation is one of the many where the need of turning your machine learning models into APIs is extremely important. Many of the industries are now looking for Data Scientists who can do this. Now, wrapping a machine learning model into an API is not very difficult, and that is precisely what you will be doing in this tutorial - Turn your machine learning model into an API.
